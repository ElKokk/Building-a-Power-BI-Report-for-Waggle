**Concept**

I work as a business intelligence analyst for Waggle, a startup that makes smart devices for pets. 
Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their new Lapdog device, a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, 
alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas! Reviews have been fantastic, sales are growing, and—best of all—the product really works!

This success has led Waggle’s CEO to push for a feline version but there are concerns about its viability.
For this reason, the product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, 
I have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices. 







Business Requests:

    The CEO is curious about the following questions:
        Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device as they did for dogs?
        Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?
    The Chief Marketing Officer would like your report to be “on-brand” by including only colors from the Waggle color palette, the Waggle logo, and other approved company logos and icons.
    The product team trusts you to incorporate other visuals and insights as you see fit 
but is most interested in demographic comparisons between the dogs and cats using Waggle devices as well as any information about the families who own the pets. 
They would also like slicers to help them filter and explore on their own.

On each page of my report, I include at least five slicers derived from the provided datasets demonstrating at least one of each of the following slicer visualization options:

    A slider-enabled slicer
    A hierarchy-enabled slicer
    A drop-down slicer
    A slicer with “Select All” enabled
    A slicer with search box enabled

Create buttons to help the user navigate the report and prove comfort with the formatting options of buttons. 
The buttons respond when users hover over them by changing color and/or size as a way of showing that they can be interacted with.

    Please create the following button types:
        Back buttons on the second and third page.
        Page navigation buttons for each page in your report.

Use Power BI’s bookmark capabilities to give users the ability to swap two visuals of your choosing. 
I use buttons or any of the provided images as my bookmark triggers, but make sure you convey to the user that this feature exists and what the buttons do. 
It must be clear to the user which bookmark is active or inactive at any given time.
